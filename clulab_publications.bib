    abstract = "We introduce CopySpec, a simple yet effective technique to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs or responses that can be verbatim extracted from context. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model{'}s chat history or context and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality and without requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using seven LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn{'}s answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM8K{'}s self-correction tasks. Importantly, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49{\%} additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context size grows, CopySpec leverages larger contexts to accelerate inference, making it a faster complementary solution. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/RazvanDu/CopySpec."

We evaluate whether LLMs can approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory (CAT). Specifically, we use Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics, which assigns acceptability scores to arguments based on their attack and support relations. Given only dialogue-formatted debates from two NoDE datasets, models are prompted to rank arguments without access to the underlying graph. We test several LLMs under advanced instruction strategies, including Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning. While models show moderate alignment with QuAD rankings, performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow. Advanced prompting helps mitigate these effects by reducing biases related to argument length and position. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate future work on graph-aware reasoning."

Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is \textit{low diversity}, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple ``expert'' LLM \textit{agents} to collaboratively generate data. Using only \textbf{25 million} tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B) to two specialized domains{--}Finance and Biomedicine{--}without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.Continually pre-training Mistral-7B with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08{\%} in Finance and 13.75{\%} in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template-based prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth."

Zero-shot RE is vital when annotations are not available either due to costs or time constraints. As a result, zero-shot RE has garnered interest in the research community. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) many approaches have been proposed for prompting LLMs for RE, but these methods often either rely on an accompanying small language model (e.g., for finetuning on synthetic data generated by LLMs) or require complex post-prompt processing. In this paper, we propose an effective prompt-based method that does not require any additional resources. Instead, we use an LLM to perform a two-step process. In the first step, we perform a targeted summarization of the text with respect to the underlying relation, reduce the applicable label space, and synthesize examples. Then, we combine the products of these processes with other elements into a final prompt. We evaluate our approach with various LLMs on four real-world RE datasets. Our evaluation shows that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by a large margin. This work can also be considered as a new strong baseline for zero-shot RE that is compatible with any LLM."

Specifically, we quantize the most important layers to higher bit precision and less important layers to lower bits. We propose two effective strategies to measure the importance of layers within LLMs: the first measures the importance of a layer based on how different its output embeddings are from the input embeddings (higher is better); the second estimates the importance of a layer using the number of layer weights that are much larger than average (smaller is better). We show that quantizing different layers at varying bits as per our importance scores results in minimal performance drop with a far more compressed model. Finally, we present several practical key takeaways from our variable layer-wise quantization experiments: (a) LLM performance under variable quantization remains close to the original model until 25{--}50{\%} of layers are moved in lower quantization using our proposed ordering but only until 5{--}10{\%} if moved using no specific ordering; (b) Adding layer importance to inherently dynamic quantization techniques can further improve their performance, showing that our approach is complementary to other dynamic quantization methods; (c) Quantizing LLMs to lower bits performs substantially better than pruning unless extreme quantization (2-bit) is used; and (d) Layer-wise quantization to lower bits works better in the case of larger LLMs with more layers compared to smaller LLMs with fewer layers."

Dynamic strategies are needed to combat homoglyphs as the Unicode library is ever-expanding and new substitution possibilities for Latin letters continuously emerge. The present study investigated two novel mitigation approaches that do not rely on strict mappings but instead harness the power of large language models to neutralize both known and unknown homoglyphs: (1) indirectly normalizing homoglyphs by replacing non-Latin characters with a delimiter and prompting large language models to fill in the blanks and (2) directly normalizing homoglyphs by using large language models to determine which characters should be replaced with Latin letters. We found that GPT-4o-mini constructed normalized text with an average cosine similarity score of 0.91 to the original tweets when applying our indirect method and 0.96 to the original tweets when applying our direct method. This study indicates that large language model-based normalization techniques can effectively unmask offensive content concealed by homoglyphs. Code and data are available in our GitHub repository."

Our approach divides IE tasks into two steps: (1) text classification to understand what information (e.g., entity or event types) is contained in the underlying text and (2) information extraction for the identified types. Initially, we use a large language model (LLM) in a few-shot setting to classify the contained information. The classification output is used to select the relevant prompt and retrieve the examples relevant to the input text. Finally, we ask a LLM to do the information extraction with the generated prompt. By evaluating our approach on legal IE tasks with two different LLMs, we demonstrate that the prompt chaining technique improves the LLM’s overall performance in a few-shot setting when compared to the baseline in which examples from all possible classes are included in the prompt. Our approach can be used in a low-resource setting as it does not require a large amount of training data. Also, it can be easily adapted to many different IE tasks by simply adjusting the prompts. Lastly, it provides a cost benefit by reducing the number of tokens in the prompt.",

This approach capitalizes on the strengths of both paradigms: the adaptability of rule-based systems and the generalization power of neural networks. Our architecture consists of two components: a declarative rule-based model for transparent classification and a neural component to enhance rule generalizability through semantic text matching. Notably, our semantic matcher is trained in an unsupervised domain-agnostic way, solely with synthetic data. Further, these components are loosely coupled, allowing for rule modifications without retraining the semantic matcher. In our evaluation, we focused on two few-shot relation classification datasets: Few-Shot TACRED and a Few-Shot version of NYT29. We show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in three out of four settings, despite not seeing any human-annotated training data. Further, we show that our approach remains modular and pliable, i.e., the corresponding rules can be locally modified to improve the overall model. Human interventions to the rules for the TACRED relation \texttt{org:parents} boost the performance on that relation by as much as 26\% relative improvement, without negatively impacting the other relations, and without retraining the semantic matching component.",

We explore whether annotating at sub-sentence level can translate to an improved downstream performance by considering two different sub-sentence annotation strategies: (i) entity-level, and (ii) token-level. These approaches result in some sentences being only partially annotated. To address this issue, we introduce and evaluate multiple strategies to deal with partially-annotated sentences during the training process. We show that annotating at the sub-sentence level achieves comparable or better performance than sentence-level annotations with a smaller number of annotated tokens. We then explore the extent to which the performance gap remains once accounting for the annotation time and found that both annotation schemes perform similarly.",

These rules include insights such as ''One Sense Per Discourse'', using a Masked Language Model as an unsupervised NER, leveraging part-of-speech tags to identify and eliminate unlabeled entities as false negatives, and other intuitions about classifier confidence scores in local and global context. ELLEN achieves very strong performance on the CoNLL-2003 dataset when using the minimal supervision from the lexicon above. It also outperforms most existing (and considerably more complex) semi-supervised NER methods under the same supervision settings commonly used in the literature (i.e., 5% of the training data). Further, we evaluate our CoNLL-2003 model in a zero-shot scenario on WNUT-17 where we find that it outperforms GPT-3.5 and achieves comparable performance to GPT-4. In a zero-shot setting, ELLEN also achieves over 75% of the performance of a strong, fully supervised model trained on gold data. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hriaz17/ELLEN",

As a result, it is currently employed in a variety of real-world contexts, from legal reasoning to intelligence analysis. An argumentation framework is modelled as a graph where the nodes represent arguments and the edges of the graph represent relations (i.e., supports, attacks) between nodes. In this work, we investigate the ability of neural network methods to learn a gradual bipolar argumentation semantics, which allows for both supports and attacks. We begin by calculating the acceptability degrees for graph nodes. These scores are generated using Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) argumentation semantics. We apply this approach to two benchmark datasets: Twelve Angry Men and Debate- pedia. Using this data, we train and evaluate the performance of three benchmark architectures: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn the acceptability degree scores produced by the QuAD semantics. Our results show that these neural network methods can learn bipolar gradual argumentation semantics. The models trained on GCN architecture perform better than the other two architectures underscoring the importance of modelling argumentation graphs explicitly."

Beyond simply capturing speaker switches, identifying how speakers interact with each other in a dialogue is crucial to understanding conversational flow. This becomes increasingly important and simultaneously difficult to model when more than two interlocutors take part in a conversation. To overcome this challenge, we propose to explicitly add speaker awareness to each utterance representation. To that end, we use a graph neural network to model how each speaker is behaving within the local context of a conversation. The speaker representations learned this way are then used to update their respective utterance representations. We experiment with both multiparticipant and dyadic conversations on the MRDA and SwDA datasets and show the effectiveness of our approach.",

Training the models using the annotated data further boosted performance (highest micro-averaged F1 score=0.88, using five-fold cross validation).

Each model’s performance on the in-domain setting and the out-of-domain setting are compared to see if the models can across the states. We found that the model trained on one US state can be mostly transferred to another state. However, it is clear that the model’s performance drops in the out-of-domain setting. The F1 scores of the Tennessee model and the Idaho model are 96.41 and 92.03 when predicting the data from the same state, but they drop to 66.32 and 81.60 when predicting the data from another state. Subsequent error analysis revealed that there are two major sources of errors. First, the model fails to recognize equivalent laws across states when there are stylistic differences between laws. Second, difference in statutory section numbering system between the states makes it difficult for the model to locate laws relevant to the cases being predicted on. This analysis provides insights on how the future NLI system can be improved. Also, our findings offer empirical support to legal experts advocating the standardization of legal documents.",

Further, we perform empirical evaluation of different strategies for combining the automatically acquired templates with manual templates.

To validate its importance, we explore two transformer-based models for classifying the videos. Our preliminary results suggest that the task of distinguishing between these types of videos is learnable but challenging. These experiments suggest that this dataset is meaningful and invites further study on the subject.",

    abstract="{In this paper we revisit the direction of using lexico-syntactic patterns for relation extraction instead of today's ubiquitous neural classifiers. We propose a semi-supervised graph-based algorithm for pattern acquisition that scores patterns and the relations they extract jointly, using a variant of PageRank. We insert light supervision in the form of seed patterns or relations, and model it with several custom teleportation probabilities that bias random-walk scores of patterns/relations based on their proximity to correct information. We evaluate our approach on Few-Shot TACRED, and show that our method outperforms (or performs competitively with) more expensive and opaque deep neural networks. Lastly, we thoroughly compare our proposed approach with the seminal RlogF pattern acquisition algorithm of, showing that it outperforms it for all the hyper parameters tested, in all settings. }",

        such as Morse code) is by far the most common mode of communication
        between humans, and can thus provide significant insight into both
        individual mental states and interpersonal dynamics. As part of
        DARPA{'}s Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST)
        program, we are developing an AI agent team member that constructs and
        maintains models of their human teammates and provides appropriate
        task-relevant advice to improve team processes and mission performance.
        One of the key components of this agent is a module that uses a
        rule-based approach to extract task-relevant events from natural
        language utterances in real time, and publish them for consumption by
        downstream components. In this case study, we evaluate the performance
        of our rule-based event extraction system on a recently conducted ASIST
        experiment consisting of a simulated urban search and rescue mission in
        Minecraft. We compare the performance of our approach with that of a
        zero-shot neural classifier, and find that our approach outperforms the
        classifier for all event types, even when the classifier is used in an
        oracle setting where it knows how many events should be extracted from
        each utterance.",

answering, but, in general, can only capitalize on direct evidence seen
during training. For example, monolingual alignment models acquire term
alignment probabilities from semi-structured data such as question-answer
pairs; neural network language models learn term embeddings from
unstructured text. All this knowledge is then used to estimate the semantic
similarity between question and answer candidates.  We introduce a
higher-order formalism that allows all these lexical semantic models to
chain direct evidence to construct indirect associations between question
and answer texts, by casting the task as the traversal of graphs that encode
direct term associations.  Using a corpus of 10,000 questions from Yahoo!
Answers, we experimentally demonstrate that higher-order methods are broadly
applicable to alignment and language models, across both word and syntactic
representations. We show that an important criterion for success is
controlling for the semantic drift that accumulates during graph traversal.
All in all, the proposed higher-order approach improves five out of the six
lexical semantic models investigated, with relative gains of up to +13\%
over their first-order variants. },

Our approach addresses this task as link prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such as ``CTCF activates FOXA1'', which were automatically extracted using open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using graph-based features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as from a citation graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated the proposed approach through backtesting. Although the data is heavily unbalanced (50 times more negative examples than positives), our approach predicts which influence links will be discovered in the ``near future'' with a F1 score of 27 points, and a mean average precision of 68\%. },

In this paper, we investigate another potential use of neural TS: assisting machines performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluate the use of neural TS in two ways: simplifying input texts at prediction time and augmenting data to provide machines with additional information during training. We demonstrate that the latter scenario provides positive effects on machine performance on two separate datasets. In particular, the latter use of TS improves the performances of LSTM (1.82{--}1.98{\%}) and SpanBERT (0.7{--}1.3{\%}) extractors on TACRED, a complex, large-scale, real-world relation extraction task. Further, the same setting yields improvements of up to 0.65{\%} matched and 0.62{\%} mismatched accuracies for a BERT text classifier on MNLI, a practical natural language inference dataset.",

Our approach uses a multi-task learning architecture, which jointly trains a classifier for relation extraction, and a sequence model that labels words in the context of the relations that explain the decisions of the relation classifier. We also convert the model outputs to rules to bring global explanations to this approach. This sequence model is trained using a hybrid strategy: supervised, when supervision from pre-existing patterns is available, and semi-supervised otherwise. In the latter situation, we treat the sequence model’s labels as latent variables, and learn the best assignment that maximizes the performance of the relation classifier. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets and show that the sequence model provides labels that serve as accurate explanations for the relation classifier’s decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the relation classifier. We also evaluate the performance of the generated rules and show that the new rules are a great add-on to the manual rules and bring the rule-based system much closer to the neural models.}",

constructs a graph of noun phrases from the question and the available context, and applies the Steiner tree algorithm to identify
the minimal sub-graph that connects all question phrases. Nodes in the sub-graph that bridge loosely-connected or disjoint
subsets of question phrases due to low-strength semantic relations are extracted as bridge phrases. The identified bridge phrases
are then used to expand the query based on the initial question, helping in increasing the relevance of evidence that has little
lexical overlap or semantic relation with the question. Through an evaluation on HotpotQA(Yang et al., 2018), a popular dataset
for multi-hop QA, we show that our method yields: (a) improved evidence retrieval, (b) improved QA performance when using
the retrieved sentences; and (c) effective and faithful explanations when answers are provided.},
